# IHL MICECAT

# TODO:
 - bias of cen galaxies? compare P_cen and P_lin on larger scales, need to subtract shot noise for P_cen as well
 - Visuallize the IHL images
 - run more sims to beat down CV
 - Goal: build a function (cen+sat - cen+sat@cen), (cen+sat+IHL - cen+sat@cen), etc. as a function f_IHL, mask_th

 - See how much IGL is from M > -18
 - compare tot, cen, sat PS with maps w/ and w/o M > -18 srcs

 - Cooray: MICECAT in low-z LF: N-body sims have problems of over production small-scale structures
   (c.f. J. Bullock, P. Hopkins). Can check this by trying other N-body cats
 - Cooray 2012 model: mask ~ 22.5, so sats are probably negligible, adding IHL on top of IGL, so total EBL increase
